# Spring-Boot-Skeleton
This is my own "skeleton" project. The intend is that this will be the basis of all projects I start with Spring Boot. I will keep updating this skeleton whenever I have new insights or useful features that every project needs.  The basis will have features like:  
- An abstract layer that will allow easy CRUD resource additions without much boilerplate 
- Sorting and pagination 
- Authentication using something like OKTA 
- Exception handling 
- Easy endpoint relation handling And more :D
