# Spring-Boot-Skeleton

This is my own "skeleton" project. The intend is that this will be the basis of all projects I start with Spring Boot. I will keep updating
this skeleton whenever I have new insights or useful features that every project needs. The basis will have features like:

- An abstract layer that will allow easy CRUD resource additions without much boilerplate
- Sorting and pagination
- Authentication setup with Auth0
- Exception handling
- Easy integration test builder with abstraction layer doing all the work
- Automatic API documentation by Swagger with Swagger UI (http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/)
- Easy endpoint relation handling and more :D
